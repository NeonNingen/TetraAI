### **Completed Updated!**

We have final reached our conclusion. I have completed the program. The true OOP Tetris AI Code.
So, finally that this project is completed, I will soon or later upload my writeup for this project.

how to make this program function!
Now that we come to the end of this program, I can say it's been quite an adventure with lots and lots
of debugging!
But I still will update this program in terms of bug fixes. Otherwise this project is completed!
