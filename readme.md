### **Rehaul Update**

Everything has been completely rehauled, I have pretty much for the past 3 months.
Reworked from scratch, and finally I have completed about 80% of my project.
I have been able to completely create a functional tetris game. 
And soon wil be adding my AI algorithm to the code!
